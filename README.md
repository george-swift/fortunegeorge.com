- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **React Router 7**: Enables fast and intuitive navigation between portfolio sections.
- **CloudFront + S3 Hosting**: High-performance static site hosting with low latency.
- **HTTPS via ACM**: Secure SSL/TLS termination with automatic certificate renewal.
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployments triggered on push to `master` branch, ensuring the site is always up to date.

## Deployment Workflow

The deployment pipeline is managed via GitHub Actions, using Terraform to define infrastructure as code (IaC). Each new build:

- Syncs the latest content and updates the S3 bucket.
